<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span class="author-p-8908">Pirates de Catalunya differs from the rest of parties as it is a horizontal organization, ideologicaly transverse, that is, open to people of any ideology (providing they are respectful of Human Rights) and ready to open new ways, enabling politics being closer to all citizens.</span></p>
<div id="magicdomid28"><span class="author-p-8908">This electoral programme has been made in a collaborative manner between all citizens who so have wished, and validated in public voting, being verifiable at our Civic Participation System by all Pirates.</span></div>

<p><strong><span class="author-p-8908 b">Ideology</span></strong></p>
<div id="magicdomid42"><span class="author-p-8908">Our ideology is based on five essential principles for a healthy democracy.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid44">
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span class="author-p-8908">Rights and liberties</span></strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span class="author-p-8908">To preserve the presumption of innocence, privacy and the freedom of expression, in and out of Internet.</span></li>
<li><span class="author-p-8908">To guarantee the respect for rights and liberties included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the fight against crime and terrorism.</span></li>
<li><span class="author-p-8908">To use open software and open standard formats in the public administrations, and thus to ensure safety and privacy of all citizens' sensitive information.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span class="author-p-8908">Information Society</span></strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">To promote the networked society, a higher Internet penetration rate, better broadband access and quality connections for everyone.</span><span> </span>
</li>
<li><span class="author-p-8908">Network neutrality is required to ensure democracy, in both public and private domains.</span></li>
<li><span class="author-p-8908">All the existing Internet services (and those that will exist) have to be accessible and free from restrictions and discriminations between them.</span></li>
<li><span class="author-p-8908">Open government – 2.0 Administration: centralized authentication, databases unification, one-stop virtual window, publication of the administration tools.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="magicdomid55">
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span class="author-p-8908">Culture and copyright</span></strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span class="author-p-8908">Culture is a common heritage, to whose access all citizens are entitled.</span></li>
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">Non-profit free exchange should not be criminalized but considered as a useful tool for distribution and promotion of culture.</span><span> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">We request public money to be managed for</span><span class="author-p-11070"> the</span><span class="author-p-8908"> authors's benefit and not just for </span><span class="author-p-11070">the </span><span class="author-p-8908">publishers's. The current compensatory remuneration formulas for private copies do not benefit artists but big publishers and wholesalers</span><span>.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">We request a new management model in which creators have the freedom </span><span class="author-p-11070">to self-manage </span><span class="author-p-8908">their copyrights or to work with copyright management organizations. Creators have to be free to </span><span class="author-p-11070">transfer</span><span class="author-p-8908"> or not their every single right</span><span>.</span>

<strong><span class="author-p-8908">Patents system reform</span></strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">We reject software patents just as they are in legal system, as well as any other algorithm or concept patent. Patents were created to foster industrial innovation, that is</span><span class="author-p-11070">,</span><span class="author-p-8908"> new inventions, and not to monopolize ideas and discoveries.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>W</span><span class="author-p-8908">e suggest a patent model open to development and innovation, that makes good use of existing knowledge and promotes technology evolution to the benefit of society, avoiding private monopolies. That is why the patent's duration has to be associated with the required investment for investigation and development, and never should be renewable, but, once upon expiry, it has to become part of public domain</span><span>.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="author-p-8908">We are against the possible living organisms patents</span><span>.</span>
